Neural Radiance Fields have created a small revolution since their appearance in 2020. During a hackathon in our lab (2022), I reimplemented a basic version of the original NeRF paper in Pytorch to gain more understanding on NeRFs and get a feel for training them. Although the results are not too impressive in terms of quality and resolution (the original NeRF had to train for a very long time...), creating a minimal implementation proved to be very insightful.


The code and some more details on the process are available on [github](https://github.com/tlpss/minimal-nerf).
