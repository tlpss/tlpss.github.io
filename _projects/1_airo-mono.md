This [monorepo](https://github.com/airo-ugent/airo-mono) aims to facilitate the development of robotic manipulation systems at my lab by providing interfaces for our robots, grippers and cameras and common functionality to work with SE3 poses, images, point clouds, dataset...

It is used in various research projects and also in our course on robotic manipulation.

Next to lowering the time we need to make our robots move, building and maintaining this repo has also learned me a great deal about robotic software engineering.
