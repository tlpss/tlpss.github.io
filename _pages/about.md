I am a PhD student in the [AI and Robotics Lab](https://airo.ugent.be/) at [Ghent University](https://www.ugent.be/en) :belgium:. My research focuses on robotic manipulation. I aim to develop robotic systems capable of dealing with the diversity of the real world, enabling these robots to assist humans in their daily lives.

Some topics that I have worked on include synthetic data generation, using keypoints to improve generalization and the manipulation of challenging objects like clothes and articulated objects. I also have a strong passion for (robotic) software engineering, which is a cornerstone of any intelligent robot in my opinion.

I earned my bachelor's and master's degrees in Computer Science Engineering from Ghent University. During my masters I also studied at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/).

Feel free to reach out, I am always eager to learn or to collaborate!
